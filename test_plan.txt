Test Plan:

- No requests in the queue
- A single request in the queue
- An invalid request in the queue
- A request going up and a request going down
- Multiple requests going up and down (some consecutive)
- Requests such that there is a same floor pick-up and drop-off
- Top and bottom floor pick-up
- Passing a floor where there is a trip in the opposite direction (ignore it)
- Passing a floor where there is a trip in the same direction (stop)
